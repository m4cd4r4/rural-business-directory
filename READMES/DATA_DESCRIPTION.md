# Rural Business Directory - Data Description

This document outlines the data fields available for the Rural Business Directory application. The data is sourced from a bulk download of Australian business names provided by ASIC (Australian Securities and Investments Commission) via data.gov.au.

**Important Note on File Format:** The source file (`business_names_202505.csv`) uses the **TAB character as the delimiter** (value separator) between values, not commas. This is because business names themselves can contain commas.
